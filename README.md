# Global-Cryptocurrency-Prediction
The project is about prediction of Global Cryptocurrency, it's visualization and analysis with insightful charts and graphs using a dashboard.

## Business Intelligence Tool used
- Power BI
I Used Power Query Editor in Power BI to clean and transform the data. This involved handling missing values, converting data
types, and aggregating data to the desired granularity. I Used Power BI's visualization tools to create informative charts and graphs to visualize historical price trends. I Used Power BI's built-in forecasting capabilities to generate predictive model based on historical data.

## Dasboards
I Built a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI that presents cryptocurrency predictions and insights including key performance
indicators (KPIs), trend analysis, and historical data.
